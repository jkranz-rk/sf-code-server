# Salesforce Code Server on Heroku

Launch automatic cloud dev workspaces ☁️

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/jkranz-rk/sf-code-server/tree/main)

## Why develop on a Heroku dyno?

- Code from any device, even an iPad or Chromebook
- Create a new workspace for each project, with the exact config necessary
- Run unlimited dynos for free, up to 1000 total hours per month. They shut down after 30m of inactivity.

⚠️: Heroku does not have a persistant filesystem. Make sure you are using a git and pushing regularily.

## Ways to get started:

- Deploy via the 1-click deploy
- Fork this repo, extend the image.
